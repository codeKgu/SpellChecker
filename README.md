Spell-checker Using Trie Data Structure

Command line program in which the first argument is the dictionary file containing a list of dictionary words 
and the second argument is the text in which you want to spell check. Dictionary is stored in a trie and 
checking the text for misspelled words requires the program to check each word of that file in the trie data structure.
Concepts include file i/o and data structures and dynamic memory allocation.
